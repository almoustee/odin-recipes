    <h2>Some Grilled Shrimp to complement the food</h2>
    <p>Learn how to marinate shrimp for grilling with this easy marinade that makes your shrimp so yummy you don't even need cocktail sauce.
         Don't let the cayenne pepper scare you â€” you don't even taste it. My young kids love it. It is also a big hit with company and easy to prepare.
           I make this with frozen or fresh shrimp and use my indoor electric grill if the weather is not good for outdoor grilling.
            Try it with a salad, baked potato, and garlic bread.</p>
